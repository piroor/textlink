  An elements with "display:inline-flex" is visually rendered as a regular
  inline box, but it is actually treated as a non-inline box internally.
  The API "browser.find.find()" (and Firefox's native in-page find feature also)
  fails to find a term across the boundary. Thus we need to change its "display"
  temporary while finding URI-like texts in webpages.
